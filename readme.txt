Risk-Based Economy makes dangerous systems more profitable, and safe
systems less profitable. "Hub" systems with lots of traders will also be
less profitable than systems in the middle of nowhere.

Additionally, some of the standard trade goods have been modified to
make profits - especially on the Industrial goods - a little less
guaranteed.

Risk-Based Economy 2 is a complete rewrite of the original OXP to work with
the new commodity set up in Oolite 1.81, though the overall effect should
be similar.
